title: Xcode Analyze
summary: |-
  Find flaws and potential bugs in the source code of an app with the
  static analyzer built into Xcode.
description: |-
  The Step uses the static analyzer built directly into Xcode to analyze your app's source code: the static analyzer tries out thousands of possible code paths in a few seconds, reporting potential bugs that might have remained hidden or bugs that might be nearly impossible to replicate. 
  
  This process also identifies areas in your code that don’t follow recommended API usage, such as Foundation, UIKit, and AppKit idioms. 
  
  ### Configuring the Step 
  
  In most cases, you don't need to change the Step's configuration. The default input values work well if you added your iOS app on the website, using automatic configuration. 
  
  To make sure the Step works well for you:
  
  1. Make sure the **Project (or Workspace) path** points to the path of the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file of your app, relative to the app's root directory.
  1. Make sure the **Scheme name** input points to a valid shared Xcode scheme. Note that it must be a shared scheme! 
  1. Optionally, you can force the Step to use specific code signing identities. To do so, use the **Force code signing with Identity** and **Force code signing with Provisioning Profile** inputs. 

     For detailed instructions on their use, see the inputs themselves.

      description: |-
        Force the `xcodebuild` command to use specified code signing identity.
        Specify a code signing identity as a full ID (for example, `iPhone Developer: Bitrise Bot (VV2J4SV8V4)`)
        or specify a code signing group (for example, `iPhone Developer` or `iPhone Distribution`).
  - force_provisioning_profile:
    opts:
      title: "Force code signing with provisioning profile"
      description: |-
        Force the `xcodebuild` command to use a specified provisioning profile.
        You must use the provisioning profile's UUID. The profile's name is NOT accepted by xcodebuild.
        To get your UUID:
        - In Xcode select your project -> Build Settings -> Code Signing
        - Select the desired Provisioning Profile, then scroll down in profile list and click on Other...
        - The popup will show your profile's UUID.

        - c5be4123-1234-4f9d-9843-0d9be985a068

    opts:
      title: Disable indexing during the build
      summary: Disable indexing during the build run to potentially make the build faster.
      description: |-
        Add `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command which will disable the indexing during the build.
        Indexing is needed for
        
        * Autocomplete.
        * Ability to quickly jump to definition.
        * Get class and method help by alt clicking.
        None of the above ar needed in a CI environment.
        **Note:** In Xcode you can turn off the `Index-WhileBuilding` feature  by disabling the `Enable Index-WhileBuilding Functionality` in the `Build Settings`.<br/>
        In a CI environment you can disable it by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command.
